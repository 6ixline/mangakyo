- It is personal project for reading manga built in react native.

It uses website scrapping tool serve on backend to get it all content. It was my very first react native project and I learn alot about flatlist, React navigation, Async Storage and many other stuff it was really fun experience :happy:.

I alway wanted a app for reading manga and while learning react native I had a chance to create one for my self so, i built one I am really happy how it trun out.
