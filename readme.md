# Mangakyo
- It is a personal project ðŸ’» for reading manga ðŸ“– built in react native.

It uses a scrapping tool that serves on the backend to get all content. It was my very first react native project and I learn a lot about React native like how to use Flatlist, React Navigation, Async Storage, and many other stuff it was a really fun experience ðŸ˜„.

I always wanted an app for reading manga and while learning React native I had a chance to create one for myself so, I built one I am really happy with how it turns out.
