It uses website scrapping tool serve on backend to get it all content. It was my very first react native project and I learn alot about flatlist, React navigation, Async Storage and many other stuff it was really fun experience :happy:.

I alway wanted a app for reading manga and while learning react native I had a chance to create one for my self so, i built one I am really happy how it trun out.
